## Details  
The SoyCultivar200 leaf image dataset was built by collecting the leaf images from soybean plants of different cultivars that grew in Heilongjiang Provence, china. It contains 6000 leaves collected from plants of 200 soybean cultivars. Each cultivar has 30 samples in which 10 leaves are randomly collected from the upper part, 10 leaves from the middle part, and 10 leaves from the lower part of different plants. The reflective scans of the front sides of the leaves are obtained using an EPSON V850 Pro scanner with a resolution of 600DPI and 48 bit true color setting.  

Naming rules for leaf images of SoyCultivar200:  

Cultivar Index+”FZ”+”_”+part label +”_”+image file index in each cultivar, where “FZ” denote that the leaf is imagined by a reflective scan of the front side, the set of part labels are {U, M, L} which denote the upper part, middle part and lower part, respectively.   

For example:  

For a leaf image named by “015FZ_U_01”, its details are: the index of its cultivar is “015”, it is imaged by a reflective scan of the front side, it is collected from the upper part of soybean plant, and the index in its cultivar is “01”.
